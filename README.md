# Vikrant-Play-store-app-review-analysis
EDA on Play Store Apps, Games and user reviews  

The motive in whole project was to analyze the data and find out main components that affect users’ decision to download app. After completion of analysis I concluded that user prefer more of free apps. Most of the apps present in play store are more or less of same size so size doesn’t affect their decision much.
We found most popular category of apps on two basis - Number of Installs and Number of reviews. Personalization wins in former criteria whereas Sports wins in later criteria.
The dataset contains immense possibilities to improve business values and have a positive impact. It is not limited to the problem taken into consideration for this project. Many other interesting possibilities can be explored using this dataset.
From the results and process we have implemented, we can conclude that we have achieved this group project objective which is analyzing the Google Play Store apps and determine trends of the Google Play Store and both of our research questions.
